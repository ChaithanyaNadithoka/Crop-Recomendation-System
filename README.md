# Crop-Recomendation-System
The Crop Recommendation System uses machine learning models (KNN and Random Forest) to help farmers select the best crops based on soil properties and climatic conditions. By analyzing nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH, the system enhances yield, profitability, and sustainability.
